## About me

DevOps Engineer in Able. Sysadmin. Husband. Father of two.

### What do I love?

My job. Reading. My family.

## Working with me

I ask a lot of questions and try to avoid [XY problems](http://xyproblem.info/).
[I see the flaw in all things](http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2016/04/28/the-flaw-in-all-things/).
The word "urgent" is very much low on my list of priorities.
[Everything is a freaking DNS problem](https://krisbuytaert.be/blog/linux-troubleshooting-101-2016-edition/index.html).
I'm always happy to help. The best way to appreciate my work is to give more work.

### Working Hours (Lockdown Edition)

This year I will be almost unavailable during the mornings. Check my Google Calendar for details.

### My setup

A terminal. Vim. Wired over Wireless.

## What do I value?

On people: empathy. On systems: reliability.
