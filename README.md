## Working with me

* I ask a lot of questions and try to avoid [XY problems](http://xyproblem.info/).
* [I see the flaws in all things](http://blog.lusis.org/images/posts/flaw-in-all-things/karnak-1.png), but we will work together to overcome them.
* The word ~urgent~ is very much low on my list of priorities.
* If I'm not available, just remember: [Everything is a freaking DNS problem](https://krisbuytaert.be/blog/linux-troubleshooting-101-2016-edition/index.html).
* The best way to thank me for my work is to give more work. I'm always happy to help.
